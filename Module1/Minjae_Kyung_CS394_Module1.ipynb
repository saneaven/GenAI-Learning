    "First, while the greedy approach, which selects only the highest probabilities, appeared to produce coherent sentences, it felt lacking in creativity as I couldn't obtain different results even when trying different seeds. On the other hand, the sampling method had some oddities (although the whole thing was strange, such as grammatically incorrect parts), but its creativity stood out as it produced diverse results when the seeds were changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when I lowered the temperature during sampling, it produced coherent sentences similar to the greedy approach. At this point, unlike the greedy method, changing the seed did yield different content, but I received the impression that the structure was similar. When I raised the temperature extremely high, although it resulted in a list of \"brainrot\" words, I was still able to confirm that the content changed significantly depending on the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when I removed the preceding content in the prompt, naturally, I could see the sentences heading in a different direction compared to the original, relatively longer prompt. I was also able to confirm that it could not perform inference on Korean prompts at all, likely because it wouldn't have been trained on languages like Korean during the GPT-2 era."
