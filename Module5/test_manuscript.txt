The sauce had been reducing for forty minutes. Fond de veau, shallots charred at their edges, a half-bottle of Burgundy that cost more than most of his line cooks made in a shift. Julian drew the spoon through the liquid—the drag was right, that sweet resistance between thin and thick where the body of it caught and held.

He brought it to his lips.

Warmth. He felt that much. The texture slid across his tongue, coated the roof of his mouth, settled behind his lower teeth. And then—

He stood very still.

Around him, the kitchen of Verre operated at its usual controlled fury. The pass was stacked three tickets deep. Ramirez was plating the halibut, tweezers pinching microgreens into position with surgical patience. The Bresse chicken rested under foil at station four, its skin still popping with trapped heat. Someone—probably Daryl—had scorched the bottom of a pan, and that sharp, acrid bite of burnt fond cut through the richer layers of stock and butter that lived in the air like geological strata.

Julian could smell all of it.

He lowered the spoon. Raised it again. Tipped the sauce onto his tongue for the second time, slower now, letting it pool. He pressed it against the back of his teeth the way a sommelier rolls wine, searching.

Metal. The spoon. And warmth. And a texture like silk that had been left in water.

That was everything.

"Chef?" Ramirez had turned from the pass. "The VIP four-top is asking about the venison."

Julian's hand was steady when he set the spoon on the rest. He picked up the squeeze bottle of jus, dotted the plate Ramirez had been building, adjusted the angle of a parsnip crisp by a degree—the motion burned into his hands through years of muscle memory, independent of whatever was or wasn't happening on his tongue.

"Fire the venison for table twelve. Tell them two minutes."

His voice sounded the same. He was almost certain of that.

He moved to the walk-in cooler, pulled the heavy door, and stepped inside. The cold seized him at the temples first, then crawled down his neck. Moisture prickled across his forearms where the kitchen's heat still clung to the skin. Crates of butter, labeled and dated in Sharpie. Vacuum-sealed duck breasts stacked like bricks. A tray of pâté en croûte, its pastry lattice going golden and dry at the edges where it had been exposed to air.

He picked up a wedge of Époisses from the cheese shelf. The rind was tacky, almost orange, the smell so aggressive it filled the cooler to its walls—barnyard, something sharp and biting beneath that, something alive and turning at the margins. He bit into it directly, ignoring the rind.

Paste. Cold paste. The give of something yielding, a graininess that crumbled and dissolved between his teeth. His nose caught everything—the pungency, the sweetness buried beneath the funk, the yeast—and his mouth kept waiting for the taste to land, the way a person waits for the second shoe to drop through a ceiling.

The shoe stayed suspended.

He put the cheese back. A half-moon of teeth marks remained in the rind. He stared at it for a moment, then repositioned the wedge so the bite faced the wall.

Back in the kitchen, he moved through the remaining three hours of service the way a surgeon operates through the tail end of a long procedure—precision intact, manner glacial. Every sauce, every reduction, every amuse-bouche that passed through his station went out corrected by memory and color and the way the liquid caught the light and the expressions of his cooks when they tasted alongside him. He watched their faces the way a deaf conductor might watch the vibrations in a concert hall floor.

"Beautiful, Chef," Daryl said about the bordelaise, and Julian saw the way the younger cook's eyes softened at the corners, the involuntary swallow after the tasting spoon left his mouth. Julian nodded. Passed the sauce.

At 11:47, the last ticket cleared. Julian removed his apron—folded it in thirds, the way he always did, pressing the creases flat with the heel of his hand—and hung it on the hook inside his office door. The office was a closet with pretensions: a desk buried under invoices and produce order forms, a shelf of cookbooks with cracked spines, a photograph of the Verre team from opening night pinned to a corkboard with a pushpin that had lost its colored cap.

He sat in the chair. The vinyl seat cover had cracked years ago and someone—maybe him—had covered it with a folded kitchen towel. The towel had shifted, and the cracked vinyl pinched the back of his thigh through his trousers.

He pressed the heels of his hands into his eye sockets until colors bloomed.

Three weeks. It had been creeping for three weeks. First the subtleties vanished—the difference between two olive oils, one Arbequina, one Picual, that he used to distinguish the way other people distinguish red from blue. Then the middle range collapsed, so that a squeeze of lemon and a pour of vinegar became the same bright blur. And now this. His tongue a strip of wet cloth left on a counter. Every flavor scraped clean.

He dropped his hands. Opened his eyes. The fluorescent tube above his desk flickered at its particular frequency, the one that made everything look slightly green, slightly institutional. The invoices on his desk were for forty pounds of chanterelles, a case of saffron threads from a supplier in La Mancha, and a custom order of high-fat cream from a dairy in Vermont that he'd been cultivating a relationship with for two years. The cream was exceptional—he knew this because he remembered knowing it. The knowledge sat in his head like a word in a foreign language he'd once been fluent in.

He pulled out his phone. The screen was smudged with a thumbprint of reduced balsamic, and in the stark light of the office it caught the reflection of his face—distorted, oblong. He typed *sudden loss of taste* into the search bar, then deleted it letter by letter, each backspace deliberate, the way one might retract a confession.

His coat was on the hook behind the door. Charcoal wool, double-breasted, the left pocket slightly deeper than the right from years of his hand being stuffed inside it while walking. He shrugged it on. The lining was cold satin against his arms.

The kitchen was being broken down. The night porters ran the floor scrubber in long, overlapping strokes, and the vibration hummed up through the tiles into his soles. The dishwashers churned—that particular industrial roar, water against steel. Ramirez was wiping down the pass with a bleach-soaked rag, the sting of it so sharp Julian's nostrils flinched.

"Good service, Chef."

Julian made a sound. Something between acknowledgment and dismissal. He pushed through the back door into the alley.

The alley smelled the way restaurant alleys do—grease trap, wet cardboard, the faintly sweet rot of produce that missed the compost bin. A cat or rat had gotten into one of the bags; a scatter of carrot peels fanned across the wet asphalt like a hand of orange cards. The air was March-cold, that particular damp cold that goes through wool as though it's mesh, and Julian's body contracted around itself. His shoulders climbed. His jaw tightened—which was already tight—so the muscles in his temples flared and pulsed.

He walked.

His apartment was eleven blocks from the restaurant. He walked them every night, a habit that had started as discipline and become compulsion—the legs needing to burn through the hours of standing and shouting, the coiled-up fury of plates sent back and pans dropped and split-second saves at the pass. His shoes—black leather, resoled twice, the left heel worn at an angle that his cobbler had pointed out and he'd ignored—struck the pavement in a rhythm that matched his breathing, steady and metronomic, fast enough that his coat flared slightly behind him.

A food truck on the corner of Ninth was closing up. The shutter was halfway down, and the cook inside—a heavy man in a stained white tee—was scraping the flat-top with a metal spatula. The sound carried: that rhythmic rasp of steel on steel. Grease smoke poured from beneath the shutter, thick with cumin and charred onion and rendered fat. Julian's stomach contracted. The smell was a key turning in a lock that opened onto a room full of furniture he could see but would never sit in again.

He kept walking.

The apartment building was pre-war, the lobby tiled in black and white hexagons, several of which had cracked and been grouted over with a shade that almost matched. The elevator was out again—a handwritten sign taped to the grate, the tape yellowing at its edges, the superintendent's heavy block letters: SORRY FOR INCONVIENCE. Julian climbed five flights. His breathing thickened on the third landing. On the fourth, he loosened his collar. The stairwell carried someone's dinner—garlic, oregano, something with tomato—and the ghost of a cigarette smoked near an open window.

His apartment door required the key to be jiggled twice, pulled back slightly, then turned. He'd meant to have the lock replaced for a year. Inside: dark. The streetlight through the kitchen window laid a rhombus of orange across the counter, catching the edge of an unwashed glass and the spine of a book he'd left face-down.

He filled the glass from the tap, drank. The water moved through him like something borrowed—cool, pressing against his throat, then gone. He set the glass down and it clinked against a plate from that morning. The plate had held toast with cultured butter and a smear of yuzu marmalade. The marmalade had left a translucent amber streak on the white ceramic. He remembered making the toast, remembered smelling the citrus, remembered the hollow where flavor should have landed.

He opened the refrigerator. The bulb inside threw a harsh white across his face. The shelves were sparse—a block of Parmesan wrapped in wax paper, a jar of cornichons, half a lemon dried to leather at its cut face, a bottle of Sauternes he'd been meaning to cook with. He picked up the Parmesan, broke a shard off with his thumbnail. The Parmesan crumbled with that dry, crystalline crunch, the grains falling apart on his tongue like tiny stones. Umami, salt, nuttiness—he knew the litany the way a priest knows liturgy. His mouth gave him chalk.

He closed the refrigerator.

The book on the counter, the one the streetlight had found: *Larousse Gastronomique*, the old edition with the gilt lettering mostly rubbed from the spine. It had been his grandfather's. Henri Vance, who had cooked in a village bistro in Périgord for forty years and died with stained hands and a palate that could identify the vintage of a Cahors within two years. Julian had inherited the book, the palate, and—according to family mythology—the obsession.

He moved past it. Down the hall, where the floorboards had a soft spot near the bathroom door that gave slightly under his weight every time, a tiny structural exhale. The bedroom. He sat on the bed. The mattress held the impression of his shape from that morning, the sheets still pulled back at the angle he'd left them. His coat was still on. He sat in it.

The closet was partially open. On the top shelf, above the row of dark coats and pressed shirts, sat a cardboard box he'd brought from his mother's house three years ago when she'd moved to the smaller place in Connecticut. It contained what she'd called "your grandfather's nonsense"—a collection of handwritten recipe cards held together with a rubber band that had fused to the top card, a set of tarnished demitasse spoons, a cloth-bound notebook.

Julian had looked through it once, briefly, standing in his mother's old kitchen with the box on the counter between them. She'd been wrapping plates in newspaper. "Take it or I'm giving it to Goodwill," she'd said, and he'd taken it, and he'd put it on the shelf, and the dust had gathered in a thin gray film along the top of the box.

He got up now. Reached for it. The box was lighter than he remembered—or his arms were more urgent. He set it on the bed and opened the flaps. The rubber band on the recipe cards disintegrated at his touch, leaving a brown residue on his fingers. The demitasse spoons clinked together like small bells. Underneath everything, the notebook.

The cloth cover was faded green, the kind of green that might once have been forest but had washed out to moss. The binding was hand-stitched, the thread visible along the spine where the cloth had worn through. He opened it. Henri's handwriting was cramped and slanted, a mix of French and English that shifted without warning, sometimes mid-sentence. Margin notes in different inks—blue, black, once a fading red—crowded the edges.

Most of it was what Julian expected. Recipes. Observations about terroir. A detailed, slightly obsessive catalog of every truffle Henri had encountered in the Périgord forests between 1961 and 1983, organized by weight, aroma, and the name of the dog that had found it. Julian turned pages. The paper was soft, almost textile, and each page released a faint smell of old tobacco and something herbal—dried lavender, maybe, or thyme that had been pressed between the pages and left its oils behind.

Near the back, the entries changed.

The handwriting loosened. The margins grew wider, as though Henri had needed more air around his words. The language shifted fully into French, and then into something stranger—part journal, part correspondence with someone unnamed, part record of a journey.

*Le goût m'a quitté. Comme un invité qui part sans dire au revoir.*

The taste has left me. Like a guest who leaves without saying goodbye.

Julian's thumb stalled on the page. The paper was thinner here, almost translucent, as though Henri had written and rewritten, erased and overwritten. Julian brought the notebook closer. His breath fogged the page and he pulled back.

*On m'a parlé d'une fraise—une fraise fantôme. Elle pousse dans une vallée que les cartes ne montrent pas. Tous les dix ans, quand la lune touche le sommet.*

They told me about a strawberry—a ghost strawberry. It grows in a valley that maps refuse to show. Every ten years, when the moon touches the peak.

The entry continued for several pages, the handwriting growing more erratic, the margins filling with small drawings—a sketch of a berry with seeds marked in careful dots, a rough topographical outline of what might have been a valley between two peaks, a word circled three times: *Oakhaven*.

*Celui qui a perdu le goût—ou qui a perdu son chemin—la fraise le lui rend.*

The one who has lost the taste—or who has lost their way—the strawberry restores it.

Julian realized his hands had gone cold. The apartment's heating pipes ticked in the walls—that restless, metallic tapping, the building settling into its bones—but the warmth hadn't crawled to the bedroom yet. He was still in his coat. The streetlight had shifted as clouds moved; the room was darker now, the notebook's pages harder to read. He angled it toward the window.

Henri had recorded a name given to him by an old woman in a village market—someone who claimed her grandmother had tasted the fruit and wept for three days afterward, and then had cooked the finest meal of her life. He had recorded coordinates that seemed approximate at best. He had recorded, in a final entry dated four months before his death, that he intended to make the journey himself.

Beneath that, in a different hand—Julian's mother's, he realized, recognizing the careful, upright cursive—a single line: *He ran out of time.*

Julian closed the notebook. The cloth cover was warm where his hands had gripped it. He set it on the bedside table, on top of a stack of trade magazines he hadn't opened. The topmost magazine had a photograph of himself on the cover, taken two years ago—arms crossed, standing in the Verre kitchen, the camera catching the steel and the flames behind him. JULIAN VANCE: THE PERFECTIONIST'S PALATE. He could see the edge of it beneath the notebook, his own photographed elbow jutting out from under the faded green cloth.

He stared at the wall. The radiator clicked. A siren passed somewhere east, the pitch dropping as it moved away. In the apartment below, someone was watching television—the bass vibrations traveled through the floor, indistinct, rhythmic, like a pulse in someone else's body.

He picked the notebook back up. Opened it to the map sketch. Traced the outline of the valley with his finger, the pencil lines so old they'd become part of the paper's texture, the graphite worn into the grain.

*Oakhaven.*

His tongue sat in his mouth, heavy and dumb, tasting the inside of his own cheek. He pressed it against his teeth. Flesh against enamel. The blankness was total—a dead string on an instrument, still wound tight but giving nothing when plucked. Every other sense hummed with excruciating clarity: the scratch of his wool collar against the hinge of his jaw, the chill in his fingertips, the distant garlic from the stairwell still faintly lodged in his nostrils. Everything except the one sense that had made him who he was.

He turned back to his grandfather's words. Read them again. And then once more. The notebook's spine crackled softly each time, a sound like someone clearing their throat to speak.
